# Pneumonia Antibiotics Treatment Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the effectiveness of different antibiotic regimens in the treatment of non-severe community-acquired pneumonia. The study compares various clinical outcomes across five treatment groups.

## Research Question

How do different antibiotic treatments compare in terms of clinical efficacy, laboratory parameter improvements, and cost-effectiveness for community-acquired pneumonia patients?

## Data Description
